It takes about 1,600 hours of coding to develop the skills you'll need to get an entry level software engineering job.

Most coding bootcamps try to jam all this into 3 or 4 months of intensive study. Free Code Camp is fully online, and there will always be other people at your skill level that you can pair program with, so you can learn at your own pace. Here are some example coding schedules:

Time budgeted | Hours per week | Weeks to complete
--- | --- | ---
Weekends | 10 hours/week | 160 weeks (36 months)
Nights and Weekends | 20 hours/week 80 weeks (18 months)
