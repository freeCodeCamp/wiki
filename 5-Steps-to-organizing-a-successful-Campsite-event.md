# In-person group programming sessions and events are fun! 

## This Wiki will help you with organizing a successful Campsite event.

With a little planning and communication, having a successful Campsite event can be easy! Here are some steps to help you in doing this:
  
* Determine the topic for the event (code and coffee, hack session, invite campers to another organization's event).

* Find a suitable location. Campsite events should always take place in a public space (library, cafe, hackerspace).

* Create an event on your Campsite's Facebook page for the event, and link to it on your Campsite Facebook Group page.

* Follow-up with reminder posts for the event 1 week prior to the event and then again the day before the event.

* On the day of the event, arrive early, get set up, greet members, and kick the event off. Don't forget to thank everyone afterwards and extend invites for future meetups.

**Try to take some pictures and post them on your Campsite's Facebook group page.**
