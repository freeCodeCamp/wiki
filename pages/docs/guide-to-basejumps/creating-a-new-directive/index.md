Do you remember custom directives from the shaping up with angular course? You can also make a custom directive!

	>> yo angular-fullstack:directive newdirective

And if you need an html template for your custom directive (maybe you’re just making a directive to clean up your HTML code), tell it to make an html file when it prompts you to and you'll be able to include the contents of that template anywhere in your app with:

~~~html
<newdirective></newdirective>
~~~
