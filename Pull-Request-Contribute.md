> A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open source project. It is often the preferred way of submitting contributions to a project using a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) such as Git.

FreeCodeCamp is an Open Source project and all of the contents are freely editable.

- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project on GitHub.
- [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to a local machine.  Do not edit online in github.com, as the editor may cause issues with JSON formatted data.
- Create a branch and make your changes in that branch and commit them.
- Push the branch online (if editing locally).
- [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) against the *'staging'* branch.

*Note:  Not all pull requests are accepted. FCC project maintainers will explain the reason of non-acceptance.*
