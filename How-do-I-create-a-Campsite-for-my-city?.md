If you didn't see your city on [our list of Campsites](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/List-of-Free-Code-Camp-city-based-Campsites), you should create your own Facebook group for your city.
 
Please follow these steps: 
- Sign in to Facebook. 
- Click the down arrow in the upper right corner of the screen, then choose "Create Group" from the options.

- Set the group name as "Free Code Camp" plus the proper name of your city. Avoid using slang terms such as "Philly" for "Philadelphia". If your city is not the biggest city that uses its name, also include the state or province. For example, the Free Code Camp group in Paris, France should be called "Free Code Camp Paris". The Free Code Camp group in Paris, Texas should be called "Free Code Camp Paris, Texas". 
- Set your group to public. 
- You'll need to add at least one friend from your city to this group in order to create the group.

- Click the "Upload a photo button. To start out, you'll probably just want to use Free Code Camp's banner (download it [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/wide-social-banner.png)), or a scenic shot of your city. Later you can update this with a picture from one of your city's Free Code Camp events.

- [message @quincylarson in Gitter](https://gitter.im/QuincyLarson) with a link to your city's group page. He'll include it on this list and also create a Gitter room for you. 
- Join our [Local Leaders Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freecodecampers/), where we share ideas about involving campers in your city. 

If you don't have a Facebook account, we strongly recommend you create one, even if it's just for the purpose of coordinating with campers in your city through this group. 

If Facebook is blocked in your country, feel free to use social network with a similar group functionality that's popular in your region.
