Our translation effort is driven by bilingual campers like you.

First we plan to create wiki articles in your language for all of Free Code Camp's challenges. We plan to eventually incorporate these translations into Free Code Camp itself.

If you're are bilingual, and have time to help us, please join our [translation chat room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Translators).
