Before submitting an issue try [Searching for Your Issue on Github](Searching-for-Your-Issue-on-Github)

Crafting a good issue will make it much easier for the dev team to replicate and resolve your problem. Follow these steps to do it right:

1. Go to FreeCodeCamp's [Github Issues](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues) page and click on `New Issue`.
* **Have a useful title**
 * Write a meaningful title that describes the issue. Some good examples are `Logging in from the News and Field Guide pages doesn't redirect properly (using e-mail)` and `Typo: "for" instead of "while" loop`; bad examples include `A bug, HELP!!!11` and `I found this bug in a Challenge`.
 * Keep the title relatively short, the description is for further information. One example is to shorten long Challenge names, so instead of writing `Test case bug in 'Challenge: Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default'`, you might want to write `Test case bug in 'Radio Buttons' Challenge`.
* In the body, **provide a link** to the page on which you encountered this issue.
* **Describe the problem** and **provide steps** so that a developer can try to replicate the issue.  Include your operating system and browser version.
 * When referencing other issues or pull requests, simply write #issue/pr-number.
* Paste in any relevant code using proper [Code Formatting](code-formatting)
* **Take a screenshot** of the issue and include it in the post.
* Click `Submit New Issue` and you are done! You will be automatically subscribed to notifications for any updates or future comments.
