[PHP](http://php.net/) is a popular language for web design, that powers sites like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org). 

It started out as a server-side scripting language, when it was created by Rasmus Lerdorf, back in [1994](http://php.net/manual/en/history.php.php). But since then, it has evolved into an object-oriented general purpose programming language.

Despite continuous [criticism](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-php-singularity/) from community over the years, for being a poorly designed language; PHP continues to be a solid rock when it comes to web development. Matured frameworks such as [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Cake PHP](http://cakephp.org/) has changed the landscape of PHP web development.
