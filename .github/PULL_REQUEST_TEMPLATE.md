# FreeCodeCamp - Wiki Pull Request Template
Make sure your contribution addresses the points mentioned below:

**Filenames:**
- Your filename should NOT contain any special characters or spaces.
- Use only "-" to separate words in the filename.
- Filenames should have the ".md" extension.
- Filenames should follow a Camel-Case format such as : `Title-For-The-Article.md`

**Formatting:**
- Ensure that you use markdown syntax for articles.
- Checkout the guides for reference:
- [Master Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Working with Advanced Formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-advanced-formatting/)

**Commits and Squashing:**
- Your Pull Request/Submission should have only one commit.
- For multiple commits follow the [guide to squash them](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one)
- If you are new to contributing then you can [use the browser](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Guide-Online-Contribution), and we will squash multiple commits for you if requested.
- However, for more control over the pull request we recommend that you [use the local method](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/How-To-Contribute-To-The-Wiki) and request you to squash the commits yourself.

**Signing off:**
- If we merge your pull request, your name will be automatically added to the
- document history on GitHub, and the repo's contributors.
- Please don't add additional bylines when creating or editing an article.

Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue (if applicable),  only if your Pull Request is addressing the issue COMPLETELY, else just leave  a comment on the original issue with the Pull Request number.
