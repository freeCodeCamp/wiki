Make sure your contribution addresses the points mentioned below:

**Filenames:**
- Your filename should NOT contain any special characters or spaces.
- Use only `-` to separate words in the filename.
- Filenames should have the `.md` extension.
- Filenames should follow a Start-Case format (i.e. Every single word starts with a capital). It is mandatory to follow this convention.

    *e.g.*``Proper-Title-For-An-Article.md``

**Formatting:**

Ensure that you use markdown syntax for articles, we do not accept `HTML` or `CSS` or anything else other than markdown. **Please Checkout these guides for reference:**
- [Master Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Working with Advanced Formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-advanced-formatting/)

**Commits and Squashing:**
- Your Pull Request/Submission should contain one single commit.
- For multiple commits follow the [guide to squash them](git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one).
- If you are new to contributing, you can [use the browser](Guide-Online-Contribution) and we will squash multiple commits for you, if requested.
- However, for more control over the pull request we advise you [use the local method](How-To-Contribute-To-The-Wiki) and squash the commits yourself.

**Signing off:**
- If we merge your pull request, your name will be automatically added to the document history on GitHub, and the repo's contributors list.
- Please don't add additional bylines when creating or editing an article.

Add `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close any corresponding issue (if applicable), and only if your Pull Request is addressing said issue COMPLETELY; else, just leave a comment with the Pull Request number at the original issue.
