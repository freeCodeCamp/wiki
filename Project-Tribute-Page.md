So this is pretty much the first full webpage you might have ever created. Some tips to help get you with this:

**List the features required by the user stories and any other rules you must fulfill**
Just write them down on a piece of paper. Having them on paper and not in a file will make it quicker to refer to them during the design process.

**Layout your page on paper**
It might sound a bit silly but this is a great way to start visualizing what the page should look like. Elements of the page you should start with could be a title, images, text and links.

**If you are struggling for inspiration for a person to tribute**
Choose me! Only joking. Think of someone who inspires you and you look up to. A famous person. Search them on wikipedia and then look through the sources of the wikipedia article for further reading. Do not just copy text from the wikipedia page into your website. Make the text original.

**If you are struggling for inspiration on the layout of your page**
Take a more detailed look at the example tribute page. Go into the chat and ask someone to share their tribute page for you. Search online for interesting web designs and see what you can copy. There is an ocean of great sites out there.

**Use a library**
Rule #2 states that you can use which ever libraries you need. To save you time, effort and confusion, bootstrap is a library.

**Your external link isn't working**
Follow the instructions at the end of the video for what to add into your hyperlink. This should then work

**Adding images to your page**
Beware to not just copy any image you find. This could violate copyright for someone. Either find an image on a [free image page](http://www.freeimages.com) and then upload it to somewhere such as [photobucket](http://www.photobucket.com) to get a link you can then use to insert the image on the page or link the image directly from the original source.
  
Good luck!
