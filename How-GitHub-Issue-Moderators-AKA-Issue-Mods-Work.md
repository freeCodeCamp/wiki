GitHub Issue Moderators, or "issue mods", are volunteers who have the ability to close issues and accept or deny pull requests.

In order to become an issue mod, you must first prove your helpfulness by leaving useful comments on outstanding issues, and submitting pull requests of your own to fix these issues.

If you've been doing these things, and want the additional power/responsibility that comes with helping Free Code Camp as an issue mod, please contact [@berkeleytrue](https://gitter.im/berkeleytrue) in Gitter.

If you are approved, we will add you to a GitHub Team, `Issue mods`.

Though you will have write access to Free Code Camp's repository, **you should never write directly to the Free Code Camp repository**. All code should enter Free Code Camp's codebase in the form of a pull request.

Please note that we will frequently remove issue mods whom we think are inactive. If you are removed, please do not take this personally - we can add you back to the team, just message us and let us know you're still active.

Also note, the number of issue moderators will always remain small due to the nature of Github permissions.

Happy Coding!
