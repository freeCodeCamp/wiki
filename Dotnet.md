[.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net) or simply, .NET is a multi-purpose multi-language runtime framework; created and owned by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com).

It has a large class library, supports language interpolability; and runs primarily on Windows.

Microsoft started development of .NET Framework in the late 1990s, and by 2000s; a beta version was released. Other than Windows GUI development and Windows Phone apps development; the .NET framework is used in web development.

It works seamlessly with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) cloud hosting platform and [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/) database. It allows programming the server side in multiple different languages; predominantly in [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx).

With [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx) as a content-rich community, there are lots of potentials and benefits to using .NET for web development.
