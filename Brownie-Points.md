The number beside your picture on Free Code Camp tells you how many Brownie Points you have.

There are three ways you can get Brownie Points:

1. Complete challenges - you get one point per challenge you complete    
1. Post relevant links on [Camper News](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Camper-News) - you get 1 point for posting a link, and another point for each upvote your link gets    
1. Help other campers in chat - each time you help another camper and they thank you (by typing "thanks @yourname"), you will get a point    

Brownie Points help you look like the kind of person who codes a lot, shares relevant links, and helps people. 

They also add to your [Streak](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/streak/).
