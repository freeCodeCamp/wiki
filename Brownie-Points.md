The number beside your picture on Free Code Camp tells you how many Brownie Points you have.

There are two ways you can get Brownie Points:

1. Complete challenges - you get one point per challenge you complete    
2. Help other campers in chat - each time you help another camper and they thank you (by typing "thanks @yourname"), you will get a point    

> Brownie Points help you look like the kind of person who codes a lot, shares relevant links, and helps people. 

*They also add to your [Streak](streak/).*
