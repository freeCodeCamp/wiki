Here is the **syntax** for while loop:
________

### Syntax:

while (condition)

{

  statement(s);
  
}




*statement(s):* A statement that is executed as long as the condition evaluates to true.

*condition:* Here, condition is a Boolean expression which is evaluated before each pass through the loop. If this condition evaluates to true, statement(s) is executed. When condition evaluates to false, execution continues with the statement after the while loop.
