Live streaming your code is an educational and invigorating experience for the streamer and the audience. If you've never seen live coding, check out the popular [twitch.tv channel](http://twitch.tv/freecodecamp). We are actively looking for more streamers of all levels to code JavaScript on the Free Code Camp channel.

If you...
* Want the immediate positive help and feedback of other coders
* Aren't afraid to try something new
* Code JavaScript, HTML, or CSS
_you should give it a try!_



**Please follow these steps to get started:**

1. Get your computer set up to stream. This process varies depending on your operating system, and it usually involves downloading software to integrate with Twitch. Most Free Code Camp users use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/setting-up-obs-with-twitch.117/), but you can find all of the supported software on [Twitch's site](http://www.twitch.tv/broadcast). Another helpful tutorial connecting OBS and Twitch can be found [here](http://www.hdpvrcapture.com/wordpress/?p=5951).

2. Contact Briana via [gitter](https://gitter.im/septimus) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/brianamarie132). She can help you get the stream key to get set up on the Free Code Camp Channel. 

3. Have fun streaming! 

**General rules/guidelines:**
* JavaScript, HTML, and CSS only (including libraries and frameworks of course).
* Language and content must be safe-for-work.
* Please use a webcam at the same time - the audience wants to see you!
* Use the chat room almost as a pair-programmer. Interact as much as possible and work together for best results.
* Think out-loud as much as possible so that your viewers can understand what you're thinking and doing.

Please contact Briana via [gitter](https://gitter.im/septimus) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/brianamarie132) and get started today!
