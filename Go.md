[Go](https://golang.org/) is a statically typed, compiled language for systems programming; created by Google. Go was made [open source](https://github.com/golang/go) back in November 2009. First stable version of Go was published back in March 2012.

> Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson started sketching the goals for a new language on the white board on September 21, 2007. Within a few days the goals had settled into a plan to do something and a fair idea of what it would be. Design continued part-time in parallel with unrelated work. By January 2008, Ken had started work on a compiler with which to explore ideas; it generated C code as its output. By mid-year the language had become a full-time project and had settled enough to attempt a production compiler. In May 2008, Ian Taylor independently started on a GCC front end for Go using the draft specification. Russ Cox joined in late 2008 and helped move the language and libraries from prototype to reality.

Go is known for its concurrency handling and performance. With an active open source community behind it, Go lets you write lightning fast web applications with it, which can efficiently handle heavy load.
