**Online Offline Editors**
**There are several offline IDE that programmers use in order to stay more productive to learn and be more productive at work**

1.Eclipse is more than a Java editor. Its biggest advantages are code completion
by tabbing method which saves a lot of time writing documentations. 

It has a build in syntax check to fix any mistype words while coding a project. All of
features we've come to expect of an IDE are their code completion, templates, integration 
with various SCMSs, and integration with build systems. 

Its code formatting and cleanup tools are very powerful. I find its build system to work
well and intuitively. I think these are the things upon which its reputation is really built. 

Furthermore it has a refactoring that find and replace function, variables and classes of a specific work. 

Eclipse offers more plugins, platforms, frameworks, and simpler to use compare 
to other IDE such as IntelliJ, BlueJ and JEdit.

2.NetBeans is a free intuitive editor that does it all compared from other IDE.
It has simple Swing GUI design tool to build user interfaces by dragging and
dropping components for instance buttons, textboxes. 

The disadvantage it is that with all its features it is slow to load and uses 
more memory than other IDE’s.

3.IntelliJ IDEA it is the most efficient offline editor however it is not free.
It is faster than most editors however it has numbers of problems. Some major
advantages is using too much memory from system,

4.BlueJ is a simple editor mostly used to teach java and object oriented
programming. The main advantage of the editor over other ones is that it does
not need a main method to run the program.

**However there are several differences between online editors and the offline editors**

1.CodeRun Studio is an online IDE that you build web application. It allows you to run and test code online. 

The disadvantage is that there is a 14 days trial then it must be paid. It is difficult to save your project since
you must pay in order to fully operate it.

An offline IDE will be more beneficial to a programmer rather than an online
IDE due to the fact that large projects will slow down and that a software
team will need a reasonable office internet service. 

If there is a major storm the connection will be affected causing many projects to be unfinished and
incomplete. 

The only advantages of online IDE is that projects can be access everywhere; there are no setup and configurations. 
There is no hardware limitation since all information will be stores in cloud.
